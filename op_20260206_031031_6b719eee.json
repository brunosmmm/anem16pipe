    "text": "Add integer MUL instruction to main ALU \u2014 MAC peripheral exists but requires memory-mapped I/O (SW to MAC, polling, LW result). A single-cycle MUL producing the low 16 bits of the product would be much faster for common arithmetic. Implementation: add a multiplier to the ALU datapath, new R-type FUNC code, route through existing ALU output mux. Consider: multi-cycle multiply with stall if timing is tight, or accept the combinational delay for a 16\u00d716\u219216 multiply.",
