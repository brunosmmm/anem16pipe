    "text": "B3: MUL not implemented in pipeline ALU \u2014 alu.vhd has no MUL case for R-type instructions. Only the MAC peripheral handles multiplication.\n\nSuspects: alu.vhd missing case for MUL function code in R-type operations.\nFix: Add 16x16\u219232 multiply in alu.vhd (aluA * aluB with result split to value/hiout), or document that MUL should only be used via the MAC peripheral.\nImpact: Programs using inline MUL (R-type func=1000) will produce wrong ALU results on hardware. Lower priority since MAC peripheral exists as workaround.",
