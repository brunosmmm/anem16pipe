    "text": "Implement immediate arithmetic instructions \u2014 Add ADDI, SUBI, ANDI, ORI with embedded immediate operand. Current ISA requires a separate LIL to load every constant. Format options: reuse S-type encoding with 4-bit immediate (limited but fits current 16-bit instruction word), or define new I-type format. Needs: new opcodes in instrset.vhd, idecode routing of immediate field to ALU_B, assembler support. The ALU already has aux_A override for shifts \u2014 similar mechanism could route immediate to ALU_B.",
