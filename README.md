==========

ANEM16 is a MIPS-like simple 16-bit processor written in VHDL, originally written as a undergraduate project in 2011.

ANEM stands for "ANEM Não é MIPS", portuguese for "ANEM is not MIPS" (name recursion only works in portuguese!)

This version of ANEM was written as a multicycle non-pipelined processor. It is currently being re-written with a
classic 5-stage RISC pipeline.

This processor serves mainly for educational and research purposes.
