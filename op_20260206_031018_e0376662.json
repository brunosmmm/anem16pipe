    "text": "Implement stack support \u2014 Add dedicated SP register (or designate $15 as SP), PUSH/POP instructions that auto-decrement/increment SP and perform SW/LW. Enables nested function calls, recursion, and local variables. JAL currently saves return address to $15 \u2014 may need to rethink return address storage if $15 becomes SP. Consider: stack grows down, PUSH = SP-1 then SW, POP = LW then SP+1. May also want a CALL instruction (JAL + PUSH return addr) and RET (POP + JR).",
