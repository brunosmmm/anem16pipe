Missing: BNZ (branch not zero) is the most critical \u2014 currently requires SLT/SGT workarounds. Also useful: BLT, BGT, BGE using existing comparison infrastructure. Implementation: add new opcodes, extend branch detection in ALU stage (where BZ/BHLEQ already resolve), update hazard/flush logic. Minimal pipeline impact since branch resolution path already exists.",
