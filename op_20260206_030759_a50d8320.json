No tests exercise MAC-specific functionality: unsigned accumulate, signed accumulate, overflow detection, config register read/write, or accumulator ready signaling.\n\nNeed a dedicated test program (test_mac.asm) that writes to MAC registers via SW, triggers accumulation operations, and reads back results to verify correctness.",
