Need to verify whether this causes incorrect branch behavior in sequences like: LW $r, addr / BZ label (where $r happens to be zero but Z reflects a previous ALU result).\n\nSuspects: ANEM/ANEM.vhd Z flag gating logic (lines ~637-650).\nPath to trace: non-ALU instruction in ALU stage \u2192 Z not updated \u2192 BZ in next cycle reads old Z.",
